# Contributing directly to the code

# Contributing to documentation

The documentation for PHRETS lives within the ```docs/``` directory in the [main repository](http://github.com/troydavisson/PHRETS).  Using the same flow as code changes, please contribute any fixes, corrections or additions to the documentation you feel are necessary.

Once the documentation pull request has been merged in, the published documentation will automatically update.
